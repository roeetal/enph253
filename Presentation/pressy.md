# ENPH 257 Presentation

From the website and a some talking to Dylan, here is what I _think_ is what is expected of us. Of course, this is all fluid, and can be changed if something needs changing. 

## General Structure

This is what I imagine as the general structure of the presentation:

- Intro (who are we, blah blah blah)
- Problem (I will email/talk to Dylan about this - do we pretend like there is this issue of abducted Ewoks, or just say "we have to navigate this course..."?)
- Solution
  - Overview of Robot (quick, high level, pretty pics and what have you)
  - Mech Components (Overview / Reasons for choices / POC)
  - Elec Components (Overview / Reasons for choices / POC)
    - Block Diagram of electronics, pinouts of TINAH/RPi, etc
  - Software Components (Overview / Reasons for choices / POC)
- Risk Assessment (High / Medium / Low Risk areas, how we are mitigating them)
- Conclusion

I think it is also a good idea to have some sort of package of calculations (as well as ones displayed in the slides) to give Dr. Dre and DJ Dyll. We will also have to fit analysis and speed of components in.

## Risk Assessment
If you see something that is missing fill it in please! 

- Can't find Ewoks
  - Poor detection
  - Too computationally expensive
- Can't Grab Ewoks
  - Alignment Issues
  - Overshooting ewoks / procedure required to readjust
- Not enough power
  - Consumption of RPi, TINAH, etc too high

This is all WIP - ill start doing block diagrams, filling in power point, etc tmmr
